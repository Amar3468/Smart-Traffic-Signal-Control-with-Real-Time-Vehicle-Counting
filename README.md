# Smart-Traffic-Signal-Control-with-Real-Time-Vehicle-Counting

# ðŸš¦ AI-Based Intelligent Traffic Signal Control System

This project is an **AI-powered traffic light system** that detects and counts vehicles in real-time from video footage and dynamically allocates green light duration based on live traffic conditions.  
It combines **Python (Computer Vision + ML)** for backend processing with a **JavaScript-based frontend** for traffic light simulation.

---

 Features
- Real-time vehicle detection using **YOLO object detection model**.
- **Lane-based vehicle counting** to estimate traffic load.
- **Dynamic green light allocation** based on detected vehicle count.
- **Web-based traffic light simulator** for visual demonstration.
- **JSON file integration** for smooth backendâ€“frontend communication.

Tech Stack
- **Python** â†’ OpenCV, YOLOv5/YOLOv8, Flask
- **JavaScript** â†’ HTML, CSS for UI & light control
- **JSON** â†’ For backend-to-frontend data exchange
